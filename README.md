# Hang-Man-Game

Hangman is a fun game to play when bored...

Although as I was bored, I decided to create hangman, rather than playing it :)

enjoy.
(and as always if you know python, feel free to edit the code and make it better)

# How to run

For the program to run correctly, you need to:
1- download all the files in a zip.
2- run only the main.py file

have in mind that you need the following libraries installed:
1- random
2- string
3- time

they all should be automatically in your python package, unless your python is weird :)
